Onto the fun stuff...

MFR, short for Monster Freestyle Racing is an abandoned project, relating to the games Monster Truck Madness 1 & 2 from Microsoft Games & Terminal Reality Inc.  MFR is a project started several years ago and has been abandoned for sometime due to my incarcaration. I have decided to release the last version I have which is 0.4.76 Beta, as well as the source code. Hopefully some will be interested in the code and can learn from it. I was very unskilled in C++ when I started this project, but have since then progressed and started working on Project Monster as well as another game. Project Monster will be MFR plus more, utilizing my own file formats and utilities. Check back frequently at www.sopegames.com for more info on that project as well as my other works. I have decided to release what is a far from completed game, but what is more of a demo. I do this in my free time as I enjoy programming and even more, monster trucks.  I have written MFR from scratch and have put alot of hard work into it, and owe many thanks to the various people which have helped with information regarding MTM, which I will mention at the end.  

MFR is largely based on user created data and is waiting to be further defined. I decided to use MTM file formats for the simple fact that there are 5000+ trucks and tracks on MTM2.com.  This was a major factor in using pre-existing data. MFR is capable of using MTM 1 & 2 trucks as well as tracks.  All limitations of the MTM engine have been removed, including texture sizes, track dimensions, model count and vertice count.  New graphic revisions have been made, primarily higher resolutions, further draw distances and faster frame rates just to name a few.

You have to edit the configuration file manually found in the same directory as MFR called Config.Xml with notepad. Setup is standard, self-explanitory.  Questions and comments should be emailed to jpez1432@gmail.com.  I know there are some bugs currently in the game and I would appreciate any feedback.
